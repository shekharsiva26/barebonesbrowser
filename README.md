Bare Bones Web Browser

execute using python browser.py  https://www.freesoft.org/CIE/Topics/index.htm

can only work with text only websites with no support for scripting. I created this when chrome was blocked from installation on my office machine because of an admin setting and ie was crashing. 

the issue was fixed and I stopped maintaining it though.
